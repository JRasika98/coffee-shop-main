          <p> Cappuccinos are a fan favorite when visiting coffee shops. 
            This is especially the case because of the latte art decorations that are often drawn into the steamed milk foam.

          <div class="text"><h3>Affogato</h3></div>
          <p>Affogato technically is not a beverage, but it is still coffee-based. 
              Affogato is actually a dessert that is meant to either be slowly sipped or enjoyed with a spoon.

          <div class="text"><h3>Iced latte</h3></div>
          <p>An iced latte is a fairly simple drink to make, similar to an iced coffee. 
              To make iced lattes, you just need to blend a chilled espresso drink, the desired amount of sweetener, milk, and ice.

          <div class="text"><h3>Nitro Cold Brew</h3></div>
          <p>The nitro cold brew is similar to the original cold brew coffee, except it is made with nitrogen. 
           creamy finish that is reminiscent of nitro draft beers like the Guinness.
